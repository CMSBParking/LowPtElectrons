# File: variables.txt
#
# This file is to be read by the MVAVariableHelper class. Lists all the
# variables which appear in the xml files for the MVA based Electron IDs for Run2.
# Variables are given line by line. The columns of each entry correspond to:
#
#     1. The name under which the variable appears in the weight files.
#     2. How to get this variable from the electron with the cut parser (NO SPACES!)
#        or if not available, how to get the variables elsewhere.
#     3. The lower clip value for the variable to avoid crazy values. "None" if no clip.
#     4. The upper clip value.
